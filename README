 -- What is it?

This is a quite simple A/V capture based on ffmpeg for Blackmagic Design
DeckLink systems.

It isn't exactly feature complete and had been used as testbed to develop
a crude avdevice for ffmpeg and then kept around since it comes handy in many
occasions since the avdevice has it's share of issues I don't have time nor
will to debug given I don't own a decklink card myself.

 -- How to build?

In order to build it just clone/unpack this on your Sample directory from the
DeckLink SDK and then issue "make". If you have ffmpeg and pkg-config installed
it will build fine

 -- How to use?

./CaptureFFmpeg -C 1 -m 2 -I 1 -F nut -f pipe:1 | ffmpeg -y -i - <your options here>

-I switch from the default (HDMI) source to Analog (both audio and video)

-C select the capture device if more than one is present.

-F define the container format, I suggest using nut.

-f output file name, any libavformat compatible url is supported.
